# API Basejump: Build a Nightlife Coordination App

A NodeJS App that uses the Yelp API. The app allows for users to search for bars in their area and they can indicate if they are going to there.

You can view the live demo here: https://aqueous-hollows-27026.herokuapp.com/

### The Web App Does the Following:
* I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
* If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
* When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
